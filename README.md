# avrlearn002-microswitch
Piotr Makulec, 26NO2025
This repo is a part of my AVR self-learning journey.
The code was written in C for ATmega328p (Arduino).
The code allows to control the Arduino internal LED via three tact switches.
First of the switches it on, the second switches it off and the third one toggles the state.
The buttonPressed() function debounces the switch.
